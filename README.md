## My Process

I started this project by sketching out the various components on paper. This helped me determine what and how many components I would need, and how to lay them out on the page. Once I had the components setup with their respective content I set about styling the page with CSS. 

### Built with

- React/Vite
- HTML/JSX
- CSS
