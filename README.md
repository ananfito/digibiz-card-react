## Overivew

This stactic React page acts a digial business cart. It features profile image, info, and social links.

Requirements: 

- Build from scratch!
- Fill in your own information
- Separate components for:
    - Info (photo, name, buttons, etc.)
    - About
    - Interests
    - Footer (social icons)

## My Process

I started this project by sketching out the various components on paper. This helped me determine what and how many components I would need, and how to lay them out on the page. Once I had the components setup with their respective content I set about styling the page with CSS. 

### Built with

- React/Vite
- HTML/JSX
- CSS
